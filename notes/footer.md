# The footer — working notes

Moved word for word out of `CLAUDE.md`'s *Intentional limits — not bugs* on 2026-09-30, so it
loads only when a session works on it. "Above" and "below" may point into `CLAUDE.md` or
another `notes/` file.

- **The footer is the artist's sitemap, and the published one navigates.** It was the last
  §10.2 section that was a picture on *both* sides, and the only one whose links were dead by
  the **header's own rule**: `linkCol` drew `<a href="#">`, which the published tab's delegated
  listener swallows (`href.length > 1` is false) and which on the canvas jumps the *builder* to
  its own top — exactly what `navHref()` was written to remove everywhere else. The Book pill
  beside them was passed neither `to` nor `ext`, so it was a `<span>` on both surfaces, and its
  label read `s.cta1`, a key no footer field named. `FOOTER_LINKS` was two hardcoded columns of
  four strings; `c.links` is now a `LinksField` repeater of `{ label, to, url }`, the **eighth
  structured editor and the seventh repeater**, and the first whose row carries two *kinds* of
  target — `to` is a section id resolved against the page, or `link`, which takes the row's own
  address through `extUrl()`. That is `BookPill`'s own `ext ? … : to` seam moved down to a row.
  `FOOTER_TARGETS` lists **every category the page can carry, not the ones it does**: a Radix
  `Select` whose value names no item blanks its trigger, so a link to a section since deleted
  must still read as what it points at, and one can be aimed at a section not added yet.
  Resolving it against the page is `sectionVm`'s job. When a section target fails (§4.3a, F25),
  the **canvas keeps the row** and `LinksField` prints "Section not on the page" under its
  select, but the **published footer drops it** — the gallery's hide-the-empty-row rule, since a
  visitor gains nothing from a dead word. Only a missing section is dropped: a `none` row is a
  label the artist chose, and a `link` row whose address `extUrl()` refuses stays a picture (the
  Soundcloud rule, with `UrlInput` saying why). `BLANK_PAGE`'s published footer is therefore the
  Book pill alone, a span with nothing to book at, where its canvas still draws all eight labels.
  The header's **Minimal** nav follows the same rule: a Music / Gigs / About label with no
  candidate on the page is kept on the canvas, named in a hint above the Navigation links
  select, and left out of the published nav (`vm.navLinks`, filtered before `navEms` measures
  it). The two columns are **derived**, not stored, and derived from the **rendered** list, after
  that drop, or the published columns would go lopsided. The frames draw four and four, so the list is halved with the remainder in **column one** — the pricing
  deck's odd-count rule, and column one is the one the pill stands in, so it is the one that
  should run long — and an empty second column is dropped rather than rendered as a `nav` with
  no children, because `links` is a flex row and an empty child still spends its gap. The pill
  takes `vm.bookTo` with **no self-exclusion filter**, unlike the tier pills' and the
  calendar's: `footer` is not in `CTA_TARGETS.book`, so it can never point at the section it
  stands in. An emptied `cta` **drops** it, which the calendar's foot pill does not do — there
  the pill sits at the end of a row of type, here it is the block the column is built round,
  and a wordless block is not one of the section's states. `showBadge` is the header's own key,
  and `vm.showBadge` already read this section's content: the seal was hidable by nothing only
  because no field here named it. `FOOTER_CREDIT` stays a constant on purpose — it is the
  platform's byline, not the artist's. `vm.footerCta` is **uncased** where `vm.footerStatement`
  and the labels are cased, because the pill has always drawn the uncased `cta1` and casing it
  would recase the artist's own words on the templates that case (Grunge and Pop case `'title'`
  since their session 0s; a template's pill that wants capitals takes `textTransform`, as
  `BookPill`'s branch does). The footer keeps **no local state**:
  every link is an `<a>` whose href is `navHref()` or `extLink()`, so nothing here needs the
  `useState` the eight sections above it take.
